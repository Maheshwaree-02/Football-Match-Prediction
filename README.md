# Football-Match-Prediction
This project is an interactive Football Match Outcome Predictor and Player Stats Dashboard, built using Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning techniques.
It empowers users to predict the winner of football matches based on historical player and team statistics, explore player comparisons, and discover top performers â€” all in an intuitive, web-based interface.

The system leverages a Random Forest Classifier model trained on carefully engineered features such as Goals, Assists, Tackles, Saves, and more.
It also uses dynamic visualizations like pie charts and tables to provide a deep, data-driven football experience.
